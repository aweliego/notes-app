## Description

This is a simple notes app.

## Credits

I'm not the creator of this project, all credits go to @bradtraversy and the original code can be found in his [50projects50days repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days).

I'm sharing this project as I wanted to expand on it on my own. I added:

- a switch to enable a dark mode
- a button to clear all notes from the interface and local storage
- an alert when one or all notes are deleted
- a timestamp at which the note is created
